# Fun with Triangles
 A web app which will make you play arround Triangles, it's calculation and logics. There is also a small quiz to play and share with your friends. There are four section to the app : 
 * Checking if input angles can form a Triangle 
 * a quiz about triangles
 * calculation of Hypotenuse given other side lengths as input
 * calculation of Triangle area given height and base as input

> This was a fun app to code, especially logics are a bit tricky, if not difficult. For the first time, with this project, I learned how to use JS inbuilt API FormData to create a quiz which also checks for answers. For the UI, I tried square input fields and square buttons. I am still not kind of comfortable with squarish designs, but it looks good, so i went with it. Regarding colors, i took some inspiration from dribble and the color combinations is one of favourites.
